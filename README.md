![](Assets/SUlogo_small.png)

Repository for the MT3002 summer 2020 course on "The Mathematics and Statistics of Infectious Disease Outbreaks" given at the [Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden](https://www.math.su.se), given by [Tom Britton](https://staff.math.su.se/tom.britton/) and [Michael Höhle](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle).

### Pre-requisites for the course 
Undergraduate mathematics (differential equations, matrix algebra) and statistics (randome variables, distributions, maximum likelihood inference) knowledge as well as some programming skills in a language with a data science component (python, R, Julia, matlab, ...).

### License 
The folder "lectures" contains the R code used to generate the lectures slides (provided as PDF) of selected lectures of the course.
Video recording of the lectures is also available. The content of the slides etc is available under a [Creative Commons 3.0 Attribute-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
